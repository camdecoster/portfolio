# Legacy Portfolio Repo

I built this site back in 2020 when first getting into software development. It's simple and clean and served its purpose well. I've moved most of the content over to my [main site](https://camdecoster.github.io/), so this repo isn't needed anymore. I'm archiving it for posterity.
